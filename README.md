ðŸš€ **Just wrapped up a hands-on networking project in Cisco Packet Tracer!**  
In under two hours, I designed and configured a small office network that demonstrates foundational networking concepts â€” from Layer 2 switching to Layer 7 web access.

ðŸ”§ **Project Highlights:**
- Built a functional topology with 2 PCs, 1 switch, 1 router, 1 DHCP server, and 1 web server
- Configured static and dynamic IP addressing using a dedicated DHCP server
- Verified Layer 3 connectivity with successful ping tests across all devices
- Validated Layer 7 functionality by hosting and accessing a web page from the internal web server

ðŸ§  **Skills Practiced:**
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Router interface configuration via CLI
- DHCP server setup and troubleshooting
- End-to-end connectivity testing
- Application layer validation

ðŸ“¸ This lab was a great way to reinforce core networking principles and simulate a real-world small office setup. 

If you're getting started with networking or prepping for certifications like CCNA, I highly recommend building this kind of lab. Happy to share the `.pkt` file or walk through the setup with anyone interested!
